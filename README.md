# Escher - A PHP MVC Framework #

Escher is an open-source web application framework in PHP.  Escher is loosely
based on the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)][1] and [Heirarchical MVC][2]
patterns and provides generous support for plugins.

**Escher is a work in progress. The framework is still heavily undocumented.**

Escher was developed by [Thom Stricklin][3] with contributions from
[Andrew Detwiler][4].
